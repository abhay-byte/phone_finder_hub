| 1/2.8–1/2.5" | 16 |
| 1/2–1/1.8" | 24 |
| 1/1.7–1/1.5" | 32 |
| ≥1/1.4" | 40 |

#### B) Pixel Size — 25 pts/camera

| Pixel Size | Points |
|------------|--------|
| ≤0.6µm | 5 |
| 0.7–0.8µm | 10 |
| 0.9–1.0µm | 15 |
| 1.1–1.3µm | 20 |
| ≥1.4µm | 25 |

#### C) Aperture — 25 pts/camera

| f-number | Points |
|----------|--------|
| ≥f/2.8 | 5 |
| f/2.4–2.7 | 10 |
| f/2.0–2.3 | 15 |
| f/1.7–1.9 | 20 |
| ≤f/1.6 | 25 |

#### D) Optics Type — 10 pts/camera

| Type | Points |
|------|--------|
| Fixed basic lens | 2 |
| Standard lens | 4 |
| Aspheric lens | 6 |
| Periscope optics | 8 |
| Multi-element premium optics | 10 |

### Multi-Camera Fusion Weighting

Scores are weighted by camera role:

- **Main Camera**: × 0.5 (50%)
- **Telephoto**: × 0.3 (30%)
- **Ultra-wide**: × 0.2 (20%)
- **Additional cameras** (4th/5th): Distribute remaining 0.1 total

**Maximum Sensor & Optics Score: 240 points**

| 50–64MP (quad-bin) | 65 |
| 108MP (tetra-bin) | 80 |
| ≥200MP (multi-bin) | 90 |

## 🌐 Online Benchmark System (390 pts)

Professional camera testing scores from established review platforms:

| Source | Maximum Points |
|--------|----------------|
| DxOMark Camera Score | 180 |
| PhoneArena Camera Score | 130 |
| Other benchmarks (GSMArena, AnandTech, etc.) | 80 |

> **Note**: If benchmark data is unavailable → NULL → 0 points for that source.

## 🧮 Final Formula

```
FINAL CMS-1000 SCORE = CORE SYSTEM (max 610)
                     + ONLINE BENCHMARK SYSTEM (max 390)
                     = 1000 points
```

---

## 📊 Internal Benchmark Indices

These derived metrics provide additional analytical insights:

### Physical Imaging Index (PII)
```
PII = SensorArea × PixelSize × (1 / f-number)
```
Measures raw light-gathering capability.

### Optical Stability Index (OSI)
```
OSI = OIS + EIS + gyroEIS
```
Quantifies stabilization effectiveness.

### Focus Efficiency Index (FEI)
```
FEI = AF_Type × FocusPoints × TrackingSupport
```
Evaluates autofocus performance potential.

### Video Power Index (VPI)
```
VPI = Resolution × FPS × HDR_Format
```
Assesses video recording capabilities.

### Fusion Index (FI)
```
FI = CameraCount × AI_Fusion_Level
```
Measures multi-camera integration sophistication.
